# Data:SMN & FAME

The matrices used for the Robust Data Reconciliation procedure are saved here.


Measurements matrices of dimension [I x length(Ki) x 10000] are generated, where I stands for the number of on-line measured variables. 

Matrices include outliers which are generated with a probability of occurrence p=0,1.

The Magnitude of outliers (K) takes the following values: Ki=[0 1 2 3 4 5 7 10]. 

The position of outliers simulated are saved in matrices: matrix_out_XXX, where XXX stands for the benchmark (SMN -FAME).
